 Introduction  
A baby’s learning after birth is dazzling. Take the acquisition of 
language as an example. Normal children effortlessly acquire the 
language spoken around them without special instruction. Before 
they can learn to read, kids add a new word to their vocabul ary 
every couple of hours that they are awake. By the time they 
graduate from high school, Americans know about 60,000 words 
or phrases, or roughly 3 times the number of words in the oeuvre 
of William Shakespeare.1 
Learning about the environment is crucial  to survival. A child must 
develop an effective neural network to do so. Nature’s solution to 
the problem needs to be robust, inexpensive, and efficient. But the 
approach is not intuitive, especially to those who perceive that most 
solutions are the produc t of design.2 
Neurons and synapses are elemental components in your body’s 
neural network. Neurons are cells in the nervous system that 
connect and communicate with other cells. Synapses provide the 
structure that allows the neurons to communicate with one  another. 
Your neurons are the nodes and your synapses are the 
connections in the neural network that is you. The challenge is 
figuring out how to build a network that allows you to speak your 
native language fluently and to understand it effortlessly, alo ng with 
a range of other essential skills.  
Exhibit 1 shows the solution that evolution found. The number of 
neurons does not change dramatically throughout life.3 What does 
change is the number of synaptic connections between the 
neurons. While the timing is different for various brain functions, 
the pattern is the same: the brain creates a huge number of 
synaptic connections and then reinforces the ones that are used 
and prunes the ones that are not used. To put some figures to it, at 
the peak a toddler ha s about 1 quadrillion synaptic connections 
(one thousand trillion), or about 15,000 per neuron.4 In the pruning 
phase, a child loses about 200 billion connections a day on the way 
to having about one -half as many by the age of 10. It’s “use it or 
lose it.”

Exhibit 1: Neural Connections in Early Childhood

Development,” American Psychologist , Vol. 56, No. 1, January 2001, 5 -15. 
This process of overproduction and pruning appears wasteful, especially considering that the brain uses about 
20 percent of the body’s energy. But scientists have shown that this approach creates a network of neurons that 
functions well in a wide range of potential environments.5 In effect, the swell in synaptic connections pr epares 
the child for lots of possible paths, and the pruning matches the mind with the circumstances that prevail in the 
child’s world.    
Burgeoning industries commonly follow the same pattern as they develop. The increase in synaptic connections 
is analo gous to new companies, each entering the industry with a novel approach or technology to address the 
business challenge. The marketplace is the environment, which “selects” the products or services that best fit 
the industry’s needs. The decrease in connec tions is analogous to the exit of companies.  
We discuss this pattern for companies, describe why investors should care, and offer some current examples of 
where this pattern of entry and exit is playing out.  
Pruning for Performance and the Product Life Cy cle 
Let’s start with some classic examples of this pattern. Exhibit 2 shows the development of the U.S. automobile 
and personal computer (PC) industries. The auto industry started around 1895, saw a massive rate of net entry 
until about 1910 , and then saw a substantial rate of net exit through 1941.6 The PC industry started in the mid -
1970s , climbed to a pe ak number of companies in 1987, and saw a decline in total companies through the mid -
1990s.7 Researchers have documented a similar outline of industry ev olution for dozens of industries.8

Steven Klepper was an economist at Carnegie Mellon and a leader in this field. This  pattern of boom and bust 
is known as th e product life cycle. Klepper identified and described six regularities in this evolutionary process:9 
1. As an industry is born it is common for the number of entrants to rise and then fall over time. The total 
number of competitors is ultimately small.10 
2. The output of the industry continues to grow even as the number of producers falls from the peak.  
3. The market shares of the competitors are unstable at first, but eventually stabilize .11 
4. The divers ity of versions of competing product s coincides with the grow th of entrants. The number of 
innovations peaks in the growth phase and falls thereafter.  
5. Product innovation is the focus early in the cycle. Process innovation is the focus late in the cycle.  
6. When the number of entrants is on the upswing, most product inn ovations come from new entrants .  
Klepper, along with Michael Gort, an economist, examined 46 industries and measured the average time it took 
to pass through the various stages, including the growth in net entry, low to zero net entry near the peak of 
competition, and negative net entry.12 The early phases last longer on average than the late ones. Further, we 
can observe that the diffusion of new innovations is happening faster today than it did in the past.  
In his book, Mastering the Dynamics of Innovati on, James Utterback, an emeritus professor of management at 
MIT, describes three phases in  this recurring pattern.13  
The first is the fluid phase where there is a lot of experimentation with product design and the nature of the 
business model. The outcome  is unclear, and the emphasis is on the performance of the various competing 
products. Companies tend to be led by entrepreneurs. This phase is akin to the rise in synaptic connections 
where a wide range of outcomes is possible.  050100150200250300

The second is the transiti onal phase where the market has settled on a product design and the focus shifts to 
process innovation. Investors use the term “product -market fit” to describe when the product coalesce s with the 
needs of the market. In effect, the customers prune subpar a lternatives and reinforce the product that best 
serves their needs. Consideration of complementary assets is also important because new companies are also 
embedded in a business ecosystem. Autos with internal combustion engines need roads, gas stations, an d 
mechanics that can fix them. The emphasis  is on how best to bring the product to market given the envir onment . 
Finally, there is the specific phase where the pace of product and process innovation is slow because most 
competitors have adopted the industry’s best practices. Companies here may be susceptible to disruptive 
innovation, where new business models, a form of process innovation, allow for entrants to compete for specific 
segments of the market.14 
Neural development and the product life cyc le follow a similar pattern because they are effectively addressing 
the same task of discovering what is useful in a new environment. The solution in both cases is to try out a lot 
of alternatives and winnow down what does not work.  
Investor Takeaways from the Pruning Process  
Understanding this pattern of innovation can help investors in a number of ways. To begin, it is very useful to 
understand which phase an industry is in. One straightforward way to do this is by measuring the num ber of 
entries, exits, and total number of firms in the industry. This fits with the first of Klepper’s stylized facts. Failure 
rates are high in the early phase and drop substantially  once the process is largely complete. Exits are the result 
of going out  of business, which is bad for shareholders, or of being acquired by another company, which is often 
not as bad.  
Investors should also be aware of the interplay between financial and technology markets.15 Here’s the basic 
story. Financial capital tends to  flow in as it becomes clear that a potential new industry is emerging. In many 
cases, the companies associated with the innovation receive inflows that lift asset prices to levels that are 
unsupported by the fundamentals. Financial capital then flees, lea ving asset prices that are fair to undervalued. 
Finally, the financial and technological markets come into alignment.  
In the fluid phase, investments in companies have payoffs similar to options. A financial option is the right but 
not the obligation to i nvest in a stock at a set price within a predetermined time. About one third of options expire 
worthless. In the aggregate, these investments in the early phase appear to generate a return similar to, or 
below, that of the broader market.16  
But similar to  the venture capital industry, the distribution of the returns to shareholders is heavily skewed, with 
a small number of companies generating outsized gains and the majority losing money for shareholders.17  
Importantly, the influx of financial capital is essential to developing the industry because it funds experimentation. 
It appears inefficient in retrospect once the market has sorted the winners and losers. But this evolutionary 
process is similar to what happens with the synaptic connections: the gener ation of options is followed by 
selection for what is most appropriate for the environment.     
Another investor takeaway relates to the assessment of competitive advantage. Market share stability is one of 
the ways to test for competitive advantage.18 The premise is that if an industry’s market shares are highly 
unstable then it is unlikely that one or more companies within the industry have a sustainable competitive

advantage. Further, an expanding list of companies that have any share of the market sugge sts limited barriers 
to entry. A thoughtful assessment of barriers to entry is central to a proper analysis of competitive advantage.19   
The degree of market stability tends to mirror the stages of industry development, consistent with the regularities 
that Klepper identified. Market shares are very unstable in the fluid phase. For example, General Motors, Ford, 
and Chrysler swapped rankings in market share in the U.S. automobile industry multiple times between 1925 -
1935 (see exhibit 3). Market shares sett le down in the transitional phase, after the market has separated the 
early winners from the losers.20  
A fourth takeaway for investors is that the industry’s output continues to increase even as the total number of 
companies decreases. This means that a s maller number of companies are taking a greater  share of a larger 
market. Exhibit 4 shows this pattern for the U.S. automobile and PC industries.

Process innovation tends to be most significant during the transition phase. As a result, the unit  price of the good 
often declines during this period.21 A lower price promotes additional adoption. This can be the sweet spot for 
investors, as the market has selected the survivors and growth is in its early phases.     
Pattern recognition is important for investors but often tricky to implement because humans tend to see patterns 
even where none exist.22 This process of overproduction and pruning has played out in billions of brains and 
dozens of industries. And it is happening today.  
The Beg inning of Boom and Bust  
We currently see this pattern in a few areas. One example is the electric vehicle market (see exhibit 5). We 
count a little more than 500 companies in the industry when we includ e automobile and truck manufacturers 
(both new entrant s and traditional manufacturers of vehicles with internal combustion engines diversifying into 
the electric vehicle industry), makers of batteries and other key components such as powertrains, and companies 
that provide technology for charging. While the C OVID -19 pandemic had an impact on the entry and exit data, 
we appear to be in a phase where new entrants exceed exits.

Cryptocurrencies also share this form, albeit at an earlier phase than electric vehicles. A cryptocurrency is a 
digital  token  that is created and maintained through a computer network via blockchain technology and therefore 
does not operate through a centr alized authority. Cryptocurrencies are one component of the infrastructure 
necessary to support decentralized finance, which combines open -source building blocks to reduce friction and 
centralized control in the traditional financial system.  
Exhibit 6 show s that there were just under 9,000 cryptocurrencies at year -end 2021 and that the rate of entry 
remains robust. To date, more than 2,400  cryptocurrencies have exited, either as the result of failure or fraud. 
The vast majority of the existing cryptocurrenc ies are likely to fail as well.  
It is also worth noting that two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, represent almost two -thirds of the total  
market value of  all cryptocurrencies and that the market capitalization s of cryptocurrencies  follow a power la w.23 
Bitcoin largely operates now as a store of value and, to a lesser degree, as a payment network. Ethereum 
extends the Bitcoin applications as it allows for smart contracts, which reside on the Ethereum blockchain and 
define interactions.24    050100150200250300350400450500550

coins ; Counterpoint Global.  
Both of these areas are in the early phase, which means that investors have to recognize that many, if not most, 
of the entrants will fail. Much of the capital that will flow into these sectors will earn substandard returns but will 
facilitate experimentat ion and product innovation.  
As the market sorts the winners from the losers, there should be substantial opportunity for the companies that 
achieve product -market fit. While difficult to handicap, some companies will rise to the top and flourish amid the 
shakeout.  
Conclusion  
An engineer confronted with a problem in a novel environment would be tempted to fashion a specific solution. 
But studies of the pattern of synaptic connections of children, as well as the emergence of industries, show that 
the overpro duction of options and pruning of those that are not useful is a tried -and-true way to solve the  
problem.   
This pattern is particularly noteworthy in capitalistic  economies  because of the interaction between financial and 
technology markets. Capital  flows are often very strong as a new industry develops. This money fuels vital 
experimentation, but since most ideas fail the investments behind them fare poorly. Capital markets are generally 
less enamored with the industry when exits exceed entrants, but at th at juncture fewer companies capture more 
market share of a growing industry.  
Investors are well served to understand this general pattern and to consider where it is in the process of playing 
out. Examples today include the markets for electric vehicles a nd cryptocurrencies.

cryptocurrencies have very small market capitalizations. See Ke Wu , Spencer Wheatley , and Didier Sornette ,
