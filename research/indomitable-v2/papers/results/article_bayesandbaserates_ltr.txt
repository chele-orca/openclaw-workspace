Bayes and Base Rates  
How History Can Guide Our Assessment of the Future  
 
CONSILIENT OBSERVER   |  February  10, 2026
Introduction  
The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for a long 
time, but use of the technology really accelerated after  OpenAI  
launched ChatGPT in late 2022.1 ChatGPT was the first 
generative AI (GenAI) tool that was easily accessible. GenAI 
creates  data rather than simply analyz ing it . 
The introduction of GenAI has spawn ed a series of opportunities 
and challenges for investors. One is how to analyze the 
competitive dynamics of the companies vying to offer products 
and services customers desire. It is unclear how the market will 
be divided among the competitors and whether the se businesses 
will earn an attractive return on their investments.  
Another is how GenAI will affect businesses in general.2 
Introducing AI into corporate workflows presents the prospect of 
improved productivity , but firms will integrate AI at different rates. 
Adept companies may separate themselves from the pack.  
Finally, GenAI will change how investors analyze opportunities. 
While judgment is still necessary for investing based on analyzing 
fundamentals, GenAI allows for more efficient gathering of 
information , increasing the output of investors who use it well.  
Companies now are investing more in AI than companies did in 
prior general purpose  technologies such as railroads and the 
internet.3 As a result, the firms making these new investments 
have to grow profits substantially to achieve a satisfactory return 
on investment.   
Sales growth is the most important value driver for most 
companies.4 Private and public companies are estimating rapid 
sales growth in the coming years, consistent with the excitement 
of a new technology and the massive spending.  
This report offers no investment advice. But it tries to assess the 
plausibility of some forecasts in the context of history. We rely on 
public disclosures and past results. The goal is to develop 
reasonable beliefs about future states of the world.  
We speculate  on the potential strategic motivation for the flurry of 
deals and announcements. Much of it boils down to deterring 
competitors and potential entrants by signaling grand plans.

A Bayesian Approach to the World  
The classic way to understand a changing world is with Bayes’  Theorem, a mathematical method to combine an 
initial belief with recent objective data in order to produce a new and improved belief (see exhibit 1).  
  Exhibit 1: Bayes’ Theorem  
 
Source: Counterpoint Global.  
The math can be daunting but the mindset is straightforward. The goal is to have beliefs that are held lightly and 
open to revision.  
The Good Judgment Project (GJP) was a team that participated in a forecasting tournament sponsored by the 
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity , the research and development arm of the national intelligence 
community in the U.S. Through careful measurement, the GJP team found that about two percent of its 
participants made forecasts that were consistently exceptional. They called them “superforec asters.”5 
Phil Tetlock, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the leaders of the GJP, 
noted that superforecasters are comfortable with numbers but did not use Bayes’ Theorem formally. He wrote, 
“What matters far more to the superforecasters than Bayes’ theorem is Bayes’ core insight of gradually getting 
closer to the truth by constantly updating in proportion to the weight of the evidence.”6 
If you accept this approach, the first question to ask is how to establish your initial belief. One way to do this is 
to use a base rate, which reflects the results for a specific reference class.   
For instance, if a company with $5 billion in sales forecasts 10 percent compound annual growth for the next 
five years, you can calculate what percentage of companies of that initial size have achieved that rate of growth. 
Then, you can update your assess ment of the probability of the company achieving its goal as the company 
reports its results.   
OpenAI.  All of this is best understood through example . In the fall of 2025, OpenAI projected revenue of $145 
billion in 2029 (see exhibit 2). The company’s sales in 2024 were $3.7 billion.7 That reflects a 5 -year compound 
annual growth rate of 108 percent.

Information , September 5, 2025.  
To assess the plausibility of this forecast, we can start with an initial belief based on what companies with $2 -5 
billion of starting sales have actually done. Exhibit 3 shows the results, based on a sample of nearly 18,900 firm-
period observations for U.S. public companies from 1950 to 2024. Note that companies can appear in the sample 
more than once.8

The data reveal that no public company has grown this fast for five years in the last three -quarters of a century. 
The results include all industries. The average compound annual growth rate is 7.0 percent , and the standard 
deviation is 10.6 percent. The forecast implies a roughly 9.5 standard deviation  outcome  for OpenAI  under a 
normal approximation , which is extraordinarily unlikely.9 
The math of Bayes’ Theorem does not work if the initial belief is based on an outcome with a probability of zero. 
As a result, it is conventional to use a heuristic to come up with a non -zero initial belief.  Common methods  yield 
probabilities that are less than one -tenth of one percent.10 
It is important to bear in mind that base rates aren’t immutable  and c an change as the world change s. There are 
at least two results that might raise OpenAI’s likelihood of success from the vanishingly low base rate.  
The first is the rapid rate of adoption of ChatGPT. For example, it took ChatGPT just 2 months to reach 100 
million users. This compares to 9 months for TikTok, 28 months for Instagram, and 4.5 years for Facebook, all 
social media platforms . The internet got to 100 million users in 7 years, mobile phones in 16 years, and the 
telephone in 75 years.  The adoption of ChatGPT is rapid by historical standards even if we scale these results 
for population growth. That said, users need not translat e directly to sa les because many do not pay for the 
service.  
Second, OpenAI expects  to report sales of about $13 billion in 2025, or growth of about 250 percent.11 This is 
well ahead of the compound annual rate over the full five years. But as companies get bigger, the standard 
deviation of growth rates tends to shrink. In other words, it is a lot easier for a company with sales of $1 billion 
to double in size in on e year that it is for a company with $100 billion in sales.  
Since the company also provided a sales forecast of $200 billion for 2030, we can roll forward to a new five -year 
forecast. The projected compound annual growth rate from 2025 to 2030 comes to 72 .7 percent.  
A reference class  of companies with initial s ales of $10 -15 billion provides a sample of almost 3,700 firm -periods. 
Here again, no company with starting sales in this range has ever achieved 72.7 percent compound annual 
growth for five years.  
In fact, even an expanded reference class, to initial sales of at least $6.5 billion, includes  no company that has 
realized that rate of growth . This sample includes more than 16,400 firm -periods from 1950 to 2024.  
Another point worth emphasizing is that growth in and of itself does not create value. We define total addressable 
market as the revenue a company could realize if it had 100  percent share of a market it could serve while 
creating shareholder value.  A company creates value only when the return on  its investment exceeds the cost 
of capital.  
OpenAI’s free cash flow was reported to be negative $9 billion in 2025 and is expected to be negative $17 billion 
in 2026.12 This is because the business is unprofitable and it is investing heavily. The company’s ability to grow 
at the blistering rate will almost certainly require  it to raise a substantial amount of capital from outside investors.  
In addition, a large percentage of employee pay is in the form of stock -based compensation (SBC). Estimates 
suggest that total SBC in 2025 was more than 45 percent of sales. This comes out to a $1.5 million annual rate 
per employee, a sum that is 7 times h igher than the next highest issuer of SBC among large technology 
companies prior to going public.13

Oracle.  In the  fall of 2025, Oracle announced multiple multi -billion dollar deals for its cloud infrastructure 
business, substantially increasing its  “Remaining Performance Obligations .”14 These are signed customer 
agreements that reflect anticipated revenues.  
As a result, management forecasted that revenues from its cloud business would go from $10 billion for the 
fiscal year ending in May 2025 to $166 billion in fiscal 2030 ( see exhibit 4). This implies a 75 percent compound 
annual growth rate over the five years.15 The Oracle Cloud business was 17 percent of Oracle’s total sales of 
$57.4 billion in the fiscal year ended May 2025.  
Exhibit 4: Oracle Cloud  Sales Forecast , 2025 to 2030   
 
Source: Counterpoint Global and Oracle Financial Analysts Meeting October 16, 2025.  
Here again, the question is how likely this outcome is given the base rate. The data show that no company with 
$10 billion or more in sales has grown this fast for five years in the past 75 years. In fact, no company with $5.6 
billion or more in sales has achieved that growth rate.  
Exhibit 5 shows  the base rates for the reference class with beginning sales of $8 -12 billion. The sample is almost 
4,400 firm -period observations for U.S. public companies from 1950 to 2024. Note we are comparing a division 
within a firm to firms. The average compound annual growt h rate is 5.7 percent , and the standard deviation is 
9.6 percent.  
Modifying a probability from the base rate makes sense given the magnitude of the company’s Remaining 
Performance Obligations. But growth expectations have to be balanced against the financing needs to support 
that growth, counterparty risk, and potential delays in completing the necessary infrastructure.

How Big Things Get Done (or Not)  
The main investment s for leading AI companies are AI hardware and data centers. For example, both OpenAI 
and Oracle are partners in a venture called Stargate Project, which is expected to spend up to a half trillion 
dollars on AI infrastructure through 2029.  
AI data centers are different from traditional data centers. While data centers used to be dedicated to storing 
data and hosting applications, AI data centers combine specialized hardware, power and energy infrastructure, 
and cooling. Compared to tradition al data centers, AI data centers have more expensive  hardware, substantially 
higher power demands, and a greater need for cooling.  
AI data centers are large projects, with common bottlenecks that include access to power and specialized 
hardware. AI companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on sophisticated projects.  
This brings us back to base rates. Bent Flyvbjerg, an economic geographer, has amassed a database of 16,000 
projects from 136 countries and more than 20 fields. Think of the Channel Tunnel that connects the United 
Kingdom to France, the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (“Big Dig”) that rerouted highways in Boston, 
Massachusetts, or the Sydney Opera House in Australia.  
Flyvbjerg  collaborated with Dan Gardner to write a book called How Big Things Get Done , which summarizes 
his research on the failure rate of big projects and how to manage them properly.16  
The results are sobering (see exhibit 6). Fewer  than one -half of projects are completed on budget, fewer  than 9 
percent on budget and on time, and just one -half of one percent on budget, on time, and delivering the 
anticipated benefits.

Exhibit 6: Success Rates of 16,000 Large Projects Based on Various Measures  
 
Source: Counterpoint Global based on Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner, How Big Things Get Done: The Surprising Factors 
That Determine the Fate of Every Project, From Home Renovations to Space Exploration and Everything In Between  (New 
York: Currency, 2023) , 8. 
Flyvbjerg  and Gardner  suggest  that project  planners  should  explicitly  incorporate  base  rates  into their planning  
(the official  term is “reference -class  forecasting”).  But few do, because  they want  to proceed  with the project  and 
don’t  want  a reality  check,  believe  that their project  or skills  are unique  so base  rates  don’t  apply,  or, most  likely,  
simply  don’t  have  the data on base  rates.   
Here  again,  a Bayesian  mindset  is helpful.  The base  rate of projects  going  off without  a hitch  is low. The 
bottlenecks  of access  to power  and access  to specific  hardware  create  the risk of longer  timelines  than 
anticipated  to build  AI data centers.  The flip side is that companies  are turning  to modular  designs,  which  tend 
to have  higher  success  rates  than unique  designs.    
The authors  advocate  for an approach  they call “think  slow,  act fast.”  The idea is to spend  a lot of time upfront  
thinking  about  how best to address  potential  issues  (think  slow)  which  then allows  for rapid  execution  (act fast).  
The challenge  is that deman d for AI is growing  rapidly  and there  is a competition  for which  companies  will 
assume  leadership  in GenAI.  
A Possible  Strategic  Rationale  for the Flurry  of Deals   
By our count,  OpenAI  announced  about  15 deals  related  to building  infrastructure  in 2025.  They  were  not the 
only company  spending.  Hyperscalers  including  Alphabet,  Amazon,  and Microsoft  all increased  their capital 
expenditure  forecasts  during  the year, and AI labs and infrastructure  specialists  such  as Anthropic  and 
CoreWeave  also made  large  commitments  to AI infrastructure.  
It is interesting  to ask whether  there  is a strategic  rationale  for all of this activity.  After  all, we know  that prior 
investment  booms,  including  the telecom  buildout  in the late 1990s  and early  2000s,  led to industry  overcapacity  
and corporate  bankruptc ies.  
We also know  that the opportunity  remains  large.  Global  AI diffusion , the share  of people  who have  used  a 
GenAI product , was just 16 percent  in the second  half of 2025.17  0.5%8.5%47.9%

Michael  Porter,  the renowned  professor  of strategy,  outlined  the elements  that go into the decision  to expand  
capacity.  These  are helpful  for analysts  assessing  the situation.  They  include:18 
• Capacity  additions . Examine  the company’s  options  for magnitude  and type.   
• Demand  and costs . Consider  likely  demand  and input  costs.   
• Technological  change  and obsolescence  risk. Gauge  the rate of change.  
• Anticipate  competitor  moves.  Evaluate  the likely  capacity  additions  by competitors.   
• Estimate  industry  supply  and demand.  Judge  what  the actions  of the firm and its competitors  mean  
for price  and costs.  
• Evaluate  cash  flows.  Estimate  scenarios  for the cash  flows  that the capacity  addition  might  generate.  
• Stress  test the analysis.  Consider  whether  the conclusions  are consistent  with the premises.   
Porter  goes  on to describe  what  he calls a “preemptive  strategy,”  where  a firm seeks  to lock up a major  part of 
the market  to discourage  competitors  from trying  to expand  and to deter  entry.19 
The challenge  is that competitors  in AI include  young  companies  such  as Anthropic,  OpenAI,  and xAI, which  
must  raise  a substantial  amount  of capital  to compete,  and incumbents  such  as Amazon,  Alphabet,  and Meta , 
which  have  substantial  financial  resources.   
Porter  adds  that a preemptive  strategy  is inherently  risky “because  it involves  the early  commitment  of major  
resources  to a market  before  the market  outcome  is known.”  He also adds  “disastrous  warfare”  can follow  if the 
strategy  doesn’t  deter  competition.   
Conclusion   
The launch  of ChatGPT,  a GenAI  technology , catalyzed  a wave  of investment  in AI infrastructure  on scale  with 
some  of the largest  investment  booms  in U.S. history.  This growth  in supply  seeks  to satisfy  a huge  increase  in 
anticipated  demand.  As a result,  some  firms  are offering  growth  forecasts  that are historically  very high.  
The question  is how investors  should  assess  these  projections.  One sensible  approach  is to mimic  the math  of 
Bayes’  Theorem  by starting  with an initial  belief  and updating  that belief  as new results  appear.   
Base  rates,  the results  for a specific  reference  class , are a sensible  start for initial  beliefs . An examination  of the 
base  rates  for U.S. public  companies  from 1950  to 2024  suggests  that OpenAI  and Oracle  Cloud  have  a low 
probability  of meeting  their five-year revenue  projections.   
Offsetting  this initial  belief  are data showing  a rapid  diffusion  of the technology,  which  signals  large  demand,  and 
substantial  short -term revenue  growth  so far. These increase  the odds  of successfully  meeting  those  forecasts.   
A large  database  of projects  from around  the world  shows  that less than 10 percent  are completed  on time and 
on budget.  Investors  should  keep  an eye out for potential  bottlenecks  in the buildout  of AI infrastructure,  including  
securing  sufficient  power  and the necessary  chips  and equipment.  
Companies  sometimes  pursue  a preemptive  strategy  in which  they announce  big capacity  commitments  to deter  
competitors  and entrants  from investing.  In today’s  environment,  large  incumbents  generate  a lot of cash  and 
can afford  to spend  large  sums  on their AI initiatives.  Startups  are in a more  challenging  position  as they must  
raise  capital  to compete.  Through  2025,  investors,  employees,  and other  firms  have  supplied  that capital.  But 
that is subject  to change.
