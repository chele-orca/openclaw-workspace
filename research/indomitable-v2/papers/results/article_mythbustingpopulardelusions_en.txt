 Excerpts from a talk given by Michael Mauboussin to the 
Greenwich Roundtable on  January 30, 2020  
Good morning. It’s a real pleasure for me to join you today, as these 
roundtable sessions always prompt me to organize my thoughts on 
important topics. This morning’s theme  is a particularly interesting 
one because it provides an opportunity to critically examine some 
issues that are often understood superficially.  
I should mention that I first participated in a session with the 
Roundtable 15 years ago, and was on a panel with the great 
economist, historian, and author, Peter Bernstein. I said then that I 
wanted to grow up to be like Peter Bernstein. Fifteen years later, I 
have aged but I have not grown up!  
I will address four myths or popular delusions:  
• The first one relates to short -termism. You hear a lot of fretting 
about the deleterious impact of short -termism, without a lot of 
concrete evidence for its existence. We’ll critically examine 
some of the arguments to see if they hold water;  
• The second is  the idea that dividends play a large role in equity 
returns over time. I will demonstrate that price appreciation is 
the only source of investment return that increases 
accumulated capital;  
• Third is the notion that investing in money -losing companies is 
a bad idea. It can be a bad idea, bu t much more nuance is 
necessary;  and 
• The final one relates to the idea that the rise of indexing has 
made it easier to be an active manager.

I. Let’s start with the first topic, that of short -termism. We’ll define it as the tendency to make decisions that 
appear beneficial  in the short term at the  expense of decisions that have a higher payoff in the long term. This 
tends to come in two flavors, in vestor short -termism and managerial short -termism.1 
It is easy to find concerns about short -termism throughout history —I have examples that go back decades. But 
a quote from a Harvard Business Review  article captures  the current mood:  
“. . . the shadow of short -termism has continued to advance —and the situation may actually be  getting 
worse. As a result, companies are less able to invest and build value for the long term,  undermining 
broad economic growth and lowering returns on investment for savers. ”2 
Let’s look at three aspects of this. The first is why some shortening of time horizon may be fully justified by the 
economic facts. For example, consider the rate of diffusion of new technologies: it took 71 years for one -half of 
the U .S. population to get a telephone, 18 years for a color television, and 10 years for internet access. As these 
diffusions speed up, so does change.3 
Another is asset lives. The asset lives for technology companies are generally  6-7 years, whereas asset lives 
for energy and materi als companies are roughly 17 -18 years. As the composition of the economy and the stock 
market have shifted  away from asset -heavy to asset -light industries  over the past 30 years , the average asset 
life has shrunk. Further, it turns out that governance scores, as  calculated by Credit Suisse HOLT, are highest 
for industries with the longest asset lives and lowest for businesses with the shortest asset lives.  
The most fundamental way to assess the market’s short -termism is to look at asset price s themselves. It is easy 
to find pundits who suggest the stock market is overvalued, and this notion is backed by evidence such as the 
CAPE ratio.4 
That alone should give some pause to those arguing for short -termism: high valuations mean the market is 
recognizing and paying for cash flows many years into the future. It’s the very opposite of short -termism.  
Here’s a simple exercise I do with my students at Columbia Business School to make this point. I take five stocks 
from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and calculate the present value of the dividends they are expected to 
pay over the next 5 years , according to estimates by Value Line  (see exhibit 1). That value represents only 11 
percent of the prevailing equity value , which means that more than 90 perce nt is for cash flows beyond 5 years . 
Assume buybacks that are as large a s dividends and you still only get to about 20 percent. In other words, most 
of the value is reflected in long -term cash flows.

Perhaps the most popular argument for short -termism is the holding period of money managers. F or example, 
Michael Porter, a professor known for his work on competitive strategy, noted that “the average holding period 
of stocks has declined from over seven years in 1960 to about two years today  . . . it is perhaps the most telling 
evidence of shorte ning investor horizons.”5 
Porter is indeed correct: portfolio turnover was much lower in the 1950s and 1960s than in recent times.6 But 
you might ask why that is.  
A long -term chart of portfolio turnover shows a spike starting on May 1 , 1975 (see exhibit 2) . That  was the day 
commissions on stock trading were deregulated. To give you some sense of the situation, the cost of trading 
10,000 shares of a $40 stock was $0.43 per share . And, of course, bid -offer spreads were expressed in eighths. 
So the cost of tra ding was vastly higher, hence limiting activity.7 
Exhibit 2: Portfolio Turnover, 1946 -2019  
 
Source: Bogle Fi nancial Markets Research Center and  Investment Company Institute.  
Note: U.S.-based mutual funds; Annual turnover rate is weighted by assets.  
Portfo lio turnover  is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers. Portfolio 
turnover is calculated by taking either the total amount of new securities purchased or the amount of securities sold - 
whichever is less - over a particular period, divided by the total net asset value of the fund.  
Further, turnover is actually down  in the last 20 years. T he latest read ing of asset -weighted turnover is 25-30 
percent, the lowest since the 1970s.8 Now there are entities that trade frequently, but they are only around  
because the cost to trade has come down so much. For example, index funds weren’t viable prior to 1975 
because of cost.  
It’s also worth noting companies such as Amazon.com have taken a  long-term view and have been rewarded 
by the market. The idea that a company that has been public for 23 years is loved only because it trained its 
shareholders doesn’t really fit the narrative of short -termism.9 
Let me finish this point with a couple of thoughts. I recognize that managers and investors feel pressure to deliver 
short -term results. All of us who seek to have successful long -term career s also feel short -term pressure —and 
that’s because the long term is an aggregation of short terms. The key is to do the right thing.  0102030405060708090

Second, the reason investor holding periods are shorter than the number of years of cash flows reflected in stock 
prices is that investors make short -term bets on long -term outcomes .10 If you want to understand the market’s 
time h orizon, do not look at, or talk to, the investors. Look at the market, which is a product of all investors.11 
II. The second myth is about the role of dividends in capital accumulation. In a paper he co -authored, Peter 
Bernstein wrote, “T hese data put the lie to the conventional view that equities derive most of their returns from  
capital appreciation, that income is far le ss important, if not irrelevant.”12 A large investment management firm 
put out research that was ever more emphatic, stating, “ Some may be surprised to learn that 90 percent of U.S. 
equity returns over the last century have been delivered b y dividends and dividend growth. ”13 Yes, that would 
be surprising —especially if it  were true.  
Let’s take a step back. The reason we save, or defer curre nt consumption, is to accumulate capital to satisfy 
future liabilities, whether it’s paying for a child’s college education or retiring comfortably.  
When we discuss the stock market in general or specific stocks, we often refer to “total shareholder retur n” 
(TSR), which assumes that dividends are reinvested with no friction. Here is the equation to calculate TSR:  
TSR = g + (1 + g)  * d 
In this equation, g stands for the stock price appreciation rate and d stands for the dividend yield.  
The focus on TSR can lead to a couple of points of confusion.14 
The first is that almost no one earns the TSR for a stock that pays a dividend. In order to do so, you must have 
an automatic dividend reinvestment plan with zero taxes. The number of people who fall into this camp are de 
minimis. Most people spend the dividends they receive, and most funds allow the sum simply to go to cash. So 
one should be very careful relying on past TSRs to plan for the future.  
The second is the belief that dividends are the main driver of investment performance. In reality, price 
appreciation is the only source of investment returns that increase s accumulated  capital.   
To understand this, let’s slow down the process. Say you have a $100 stock that pays a $3 dividend. The day 
that dividend is paid, you have a stock worth $97 and a dividend worth $3  (the stock is actually marked down on 
the ex -dividend date) . You earn the T SR only if you reinvest the full $3 into the stock to restore your investment 
to $100. From there, it is clear that price appreciation  is the driver of accumulated wealth.  
Your capital accumulation is a function of how much you invest, how long you invest,  and price appreciation. By 
the way, there is also massive confusion about share buybacks, which I won’t go into now.  
I will add that there is very robust evidence about the relationship between asset growth and TSRs. Companies 
that have grow n assets rapi dly have tended  to deliver poor returns, whereas  those that have grown  modestly, 
or even contract ed, have done  well. So returning  capital to shareholders is important.15 
One last note: m uch of what I’ve just discussed about dividends is  summarized in a pap er that was published in 
the Journal of Portfolio Management in 2006 by my mentor, collaborator, and friend, Al Rappaport. Peter 
Bernstein read the paper and called it “masterful” and wondered out loud why no one had pointed out this 
analysis to him before . Bernstein was still open to learning at the age of 86!  
III. The third myth is about companies that lose money. Jay Ritter, a professor of finance and a  leading authority 
on initial public offerings (IPO’s), reports that 74 percent of companies that did a n IPO in 2019 lost money, which 
is about where the level was in 1999, near the peak of the dot -com bubble.16 Further, about 40 percent of listed 
--- Page 5 ---
  
 
 
© 2022 Morgan Stanley . 4751059  Exp. 05/31/2023 5 
 
companies in the U.S. lose money —all this against a backdrop of a solid economy.17 The implication is that 
things have returned to a frothy state —and certainly the saga of WeWork fanned the flames of that narrative.  
Here’s a short quiz  for you : what if I offered you shares of a company just listed on the New York Stock Exchange 
and told  you with absolute certainty  it would have negative free cash flow for each of the next 15 years. Would 
you buy it?  
Well, there was a little company like that and it was called Wal -Mart Stores, Inc. From the beginning of 1972 
through the end of 1986, Walma rt generated  TSRs of 33 percent versus the S&P 500’s 11 percent. Investors in 
Walmart would have ended the period with almost 16 times more  capital than investors in the broader market.  
Walmart was such a good stock because it earned a very high return on  its investments. In those cases, you 
want a company to invest as much as it possibly can —even if the investment is larger than earnings and the 
company has to access external sources of capital to do so.  
So what does that have to do with what’s going on now? There has been a watershed change in the form in 
which companies invest. In 1977, tangible investment was 2 times that of intangible investment. Today, 
intangible investment is 1.5 times tangible investment  (see exhibit 3) . Tangible investments appear  on the 
balance sheet; intangible assets tend to appear on the income statement as an expense.18 
Exhibit 3: The Rise of Intangible Investments, 1977 -2017  
 
Source: Unpublished update to Corrado and Hulten (2010) using methods and sources developed in Corra do and Hao 
(2013) and in Corrado et al . (2016) and Corrado et al . (2017) for INTAN -Invest© and the SPINTAN project, respectively. 
The SPINTAN project was funded by the European Commission FP -7 grant agreement 612774.  
Note: Nonresidential business investmen t relative to business sector gross value added.  
So what’s the solution? If you want apples -to-apples comparisons, you must capitalize the investments that are 
now on the income statement. I n other words, put them on the balance sheet as we used to. The immediate 
impact is that earnings  and book value both go up.19  
This relates to the challenging time for value investors, who tend to build portfolios that rely on statistical factors 
such as price -to-book and price -to-earnings multiples . Baruch Lev and Anup Srivastava, professors of 
accounting, made these adjustments and found that 40 -60 percent  of stocks that had been classified as “value” 024681012141618

or “glamour” shift categories. Further, they found that the adjustments lead to factors with much better signals 
for building portfolios.20 
This also addresses the concern that comp anies are underinvesting and returning too much money to 
shareholders. If investments on the income statement are properly categorized, firms have actually been 
increasing  their operating investments  over time . 
I believe this myth has created opportunity f or investors who are willing to roll up their sleeves to really 
understand unit economics.21 If you knew how good Walmart’s store economics were, you would have stood 
behind them applauding as they spent more on investments than they earned in income. Like wise, some 
companies today are losing money but have extremely attractive economics, and others are losing money the 
old-fashioned way —with bad business models.  
IV. I hear a lot of successful investors say that the  rise of indexing has made it easier  to be  an active manager. 
Seth Klarman, the founder and CEO of the Baupost Group whom I admire deeply, echoed this refrain when he 
said, “[Indexing]  should give long -term valu e investors a distinct advantage. T he inherent irony of the efficient 
market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more 
inefficient the market is likely to become. ”22  
On the surface, this sounds like a plausible case: fewer people are competing and less information is finding its 
way in to markets, hence it’s easier to express your skill by finding mispriced assets. But I think the opposite may 
be true, and here’s why.  
A good starting point is “The Arithmetic of Active Management” by professor of finance and Nobel -Prize winner, 
Bill Sharp e.23 The idea is simple:  Before costs, the return on the average actively managed dollar will equal the 
return on the average passively managed dollar. And after costs, the  return on the average actively -managed 
dollar will be less than the return on the average passively -managed dollar.  
Now this isn’t by itself any revelation for active managers. Alpha before fees is zero by definition. What is 
important is that for you to earn positive alpha, someone on the other side of your trades has to earn negative 
alpha.  
To make this more vivid, imagine that I invite you to my house Friday  night to play poker, and let’s assume that 
you want to make some money. Upon receiving the invitation, your first question shou ld be, “Who else will be 
there?”  
If I tell you there will be some rich people who are much worse players than you are, you’ll immediately make 
plans to join me. There’s no guarantee you’ll win, but over time your skill will allow you to take money from th ose 
patsies.  
On the other hand, if I tell you that the players who are coming over are all better players than you are, you 
should arrange some alternative plans. In this case, it should be clear that you are the patsy —which is not good 
if you like to keep  your money.24 
I think the poker story carries over well to the investment management industry. My conjecture is that the 
investors who have turned to indexing are on average the weaker players.  
To stretch this analogy, the weak players are sitting at you r poker table drinking your beer but are not playing —
so they can’t win or lose. And the reason I mention that they are drinking your beer is because they really are

free riding: indexers rely on active management for price discovery and liquidity. So activ e management fees 
subsidize the index management industry.  
So if my argument is reasonably accurate, you are left playing the stronger players, making it harder , not easier, 
to generate risk -adjusted excess returns, or alpha. And while there’s little doubt  that indexing has and will create 
distortions in markets, there remain a substantial number of active managers at the ready to arbitrage those 
opportunities.  
In summary, I want to encourage you to always go back to first principles when considering what the pundits 
say or assert. The motto of the Royal Society, “Nullius in verba,” is a useful way to think. It is meant to mean 
“take nobody’s word for it.” The investment industry is, and has always been, replete with myths and delusions. 
Our job is to bust them whenever appropriate.
