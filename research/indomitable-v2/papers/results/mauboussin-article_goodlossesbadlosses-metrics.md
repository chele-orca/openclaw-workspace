# Good Losses, Bad Losses — Metrics Summary

## Core Thesis
Not all losses are equal. Companies can show GAAP losses while creating value (investing in intangibles) or show GAAP profits while destroying value. Distinguishing between "good losses" and "bad losses" is critical for investment success.

## KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Historical Returns (1980-2017, Russell 3000)

| Category | Cumulative Return | Relative Performance |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **GAAP Losers** | $20.82 | Baseline (best) |
| **Profitable Companies** | $7.65 | 37% of GAAP losers |
| **Real Losers** | $1.90 | 9% of GAAP losers |

**Key Insight:** GAAP losers outperformed profitable companies **2.7x** and real losers **11x** over 37 years.

### Company Valuation Comparison (Exhibit 2)

| Company | Intrinsic Value | GAAP Status | Economic Reality | Value Ratio |
|---------|----------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| **A** (Steady-state) | $4,705.4 | Profitable | Profitable | 100% |
| **B** (Growth investor) | $4,705.4 | **Loss-making** | **Actually profitable** | 100% |
| **C** (Value destroyer) | $985.4 | Profitable | Real loser | 21% |

**Critical Finding:** Companies A and B have IDENTICAL value despite B showing GAAP losses. Company C worth only 21% despite appearing profitable.

### Intangible Investment Trends (Exhibit 3)

| Metric | 2001 | 2021 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Intangible/CapEx Ratio** | 1.0x | 2.0x | +100% |
| **Trend** | Rising | Accelerating | Structural shift |

**Key Finding:** Intangible investments now **2x capital expenditures** (vs equal in 2001).

### GAAP Accounting Impact

| Finding | Percentage | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **GAAP Losses → Profits (when adjusted)** | 40% | Nearly half of "losers" actually profitable |
| **Intangible Economy Growth** | Rising trend | GAAP increasingly obsolete |

---

## CORE FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Free Cash Flow Formula (Adjusted)
```
FCF = NOPAT - Investment in Growth

Where:
- NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax (adjusted for intangibles)
- Investment in Growth = CapEx + Working Capital + Intangible Investments
```

### 2. Company Classification Matrix

```
               GAAP Profitable    |    GAAP Loss-Making
             _____________________|_____________________
Real         |                    |                     |
Profitable   |  Company A         |  Company B          |
             |  (Boring winner)   |  (Misunderstood)    |
             |_____________________|_____________________|
Real         |                    |                     |
Loss-Making  |  Company C         |  Real Losers        |
             |  (Value trap!)     |  (Obvious losers)   |
             |_____________________|_____________________|
```

### 3. Intangible Asset Capitalization Process

**Step 1:** Identify intangible investments
- R&D spending
- Marketing & advertising
- Software development
- Customer acquisition costs
- Employee training
- Brand development

**Step 2:** Capitalize (create balance sheet asset)

**Step 3:** Amortize over useful life
- R&D: 3-5 years
- Software: 3-5 years  
- Marketing: 1-3 years
- Customer acquisition: 3-7 years

**Step 4:** Recalculate NOPAT
```
Adjusted NOPAT = 
  Reported Operating Income
  + Intangible Investments
  - Intangible Amortization
  - Cash Taxes
```

### 4. "Accounting Aphasia" Concept

**Definition:** Systematic inability of GAAP to recognize intangible investments as assets.

**Result:** 
- Growth companies appear unprofitable
- Mature companies appear more profitable than they are
- Massive mispricing opportunities

## SCREENING METRICS

### "Good Loss" Company Indicators

| Metric | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Gross Margin** | >50% (>70% for software) | Shows operating leverage |
| **Revenue Growth** | >30% YoY | Justifies investment intensity |
| **R&D + S&M / Revenue** | 50-100%+ | High intangible investment |
| **CAC Payback Period** | <18 months | Acceptable investment horizon |
| **LTV/CAC Ratio** | >3x | Unit economics work |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | >100% | Expanding customer value |
| **Cash Runway** | >24 months | Can reach profitability |

### "Real Loser" Warning Signs

| Metric | Threshold | Red Flag |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Gross Margin** | <20% or declining | No path to profitability |
| **Revenue Growth** | <10% YoY | Not justifying investments |
| **Cash Burn** | Accelerating + flat revenue | Value destruction |
| **Customer Churn** | >5% monthly (B2C), >20% annual (B2B) | Broken model |
| **ROIC** | Negative and worsening | Misallocating capital |

## SECTOR APPLICATIONS

### High Intangible Sectors (Most GAAP Losers)
1. **Software/SaaS** - R&D and S&M expensed, building customer base
2. **Biotechnology** - Clinical trials expensed, creating patent-protected drugs
3. **E-commerce** - Customer acquisition and tech infrastructure
4. **Media/Streaming** - Content creation and subscriber acquisition

### Low Intangible Sectors
1. **Utilities** - CapEx-heavy, already capitalized
2. **Traditional Retail** - Inventory and fixed assets dominate
3. **Commodities** - Physical assets, GAAP works well

---

## VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

### Traditional vs Adjusted Metrics

| Situation | Avoid | Use Instead |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Pre-profit growth** | P/E ratio | EV/Sales, EV/Gross Profit |
| **Heavy R&D** | Reported earnings | Adjusted NOPAT (capitalize R&D) |
| **Customer acquisition** | GAAP profit margin | Unit economics (LTV/CAC) |
| **Platform/network** | Current profitability | NPV of customer cohorts |

### Unit Economics Formulas

```
LTV (Lifetime Value) = 
  (Avg Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) = 
  Sales & Marketing Expense / New Customers Acquired

LTV/CAC Ratio = LTV / CAC
  (Should be >3x for sustainable model)

Payback Period = 
  CAC / (Monthly Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin)
  (Should be <18 months)
```

## RISK METRICS

### Portfolio Risk Management

| Risk Type | Metric | Threshold |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Position Size** | % of portfolio | Max 2-3% per stock |
| **Cash Runway** | Months of burn | >24 months minimum |
| **Debt/Equity** | Leverage ratio | <1.0x (profitable), <0.5x (unprofitable) |
| **Concentration** | Number of positions | 15-25 for diversification |
| **Holding Period** | Years | 3-5 years minimum |

---

## ECONOMIC PROFIT CALCULATION

```
Invested Capital (Adjusted) = 
  Operating Working Capital
  + Net PP&E
  + Capitalized Intangible Assets
  + Goodwill

Adjusted ROIC = 
  Adjusted NOPAT / Invested Capital (Adjusted)

Economic Profit = 
  Invested Capital × (Adjusted ROIC - WACC)
```

**Key Insight:** Company B shows positive economic profit when properly measured, despite GAAP losses.

## APPENDIX INSIGHTS (Pages 7-9)

### 12-Year Financial Projections
**Company A:** Stable NOPAT, no growth investments, terminal value calculation
**Company B:** Initial losses, rising intangible base, eventual high profitability, NPV = Company A
**Company C:** Appears profitable year-over-year, cumulative value destruction, low terminal value

**Methodology:**
- Explicit DCF with 12-year forecast
- WACC assumptions
- Terminal value calculations
- Demonstrates why A and B have identical value, C is worth 79% less

## STRATEGIC TAKEAWAYS

1. **Don't Screen Out Unprofitable Companies** - You'll miss the best performers (3x+ outperformance)

2. **Focus on Economic Reality, Not GAAP** - 40% of reported losses are actually profits when adjusted

3. **Master Intangible Capitalization** - Critical skill for analyzing modern businesses

4. **Unit Economics > GAAP Earnings** - For growth companies, LTV/CAC more important than P/E

5. **Beware the Profitable Loser** - Company C scenario is most dangerous (looks safe, actually dying)

6. **Time Horizon Matters** - Good loss payoffs take 3-7 years, requires patience

7. **Sector Expertise Required** - Deep knowledge of SaaS, biotech, platforms essential

8. **Market is Efficient Here** - Despite GAAP distortions, aggregate returns show markets see through to reality
