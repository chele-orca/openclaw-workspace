Comstock's production cost per Mcfe in the fourth quarter averaged $0.77 per Mcfe, which was comprised of $0.38 for gathering and transportation costs, $0.25 for lease operating costs, $0.07 for production and other taxes and $0.07 for cash general and administrative expenses. Comstock's unhedged and hedged operating margins were 77% in the fourth quarter of 2025.
Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2025
For the year ended December 31, 2025, Comstock realized $3.21 per Mcf after hedging for its natural gas production of 450 Bcf.

Operating cash flow (excluding changes in working capital) generated during the year was $861.3 million, and net income was $420.2 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Net income during the year included a pre-tax gain of $291.9 million for the sale of its natural gas and oil properties and a pre-tax $62.4 million unrealized gain on hedging contracts held for risk management. Excluding these items, the impairment and exploration expense, adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2025 was $159.9 million or $0.54 per diluted share.
Comstock's production cost per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2025 averaged $0.79 per Mcfe, which was comprised of $0.37 for gathering and transportation costs, $0.27 for lease operating costs, $0.09 for production and other taxes and $0.06 for cash general and administrative expenses.

Comstock drilled 52 (44.2 net) operated horizontal Haynesville/Bossier shale wells in 2025, which had an average lateral length of 11,187 feet. Comstock also turned 47 (40.3 net) operated wells to sales in 2025, which had an average initial production rate of 27 MMcf per day.
Since its last operational update in October, Comstock has turned eleven (9.4 net) operated Haynesville/Bossier shale wells to sales. These wells had initial production rates that averaged 27 MMcf per day. The completed lateral length of these wells averaged 10,063 feet. Included in these wells, Comstock turned an additional four (4.0 net) operated Western Haynesville/Bossier shale wells to sales as follows:

These wells had average initial daily production rates of 29 MMcf per day and average completed lateral lengths of 8,399 feet.
2025 Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
Comstock also announced that proved natural gas and oil reserves as of December 31, 2025 were estimated at 7.0 trillion cubic feet equivalent ("Tcfe") as compared to 3.8 Tcfe as of December 31, 2024. The reserve estimates were determined under SEC guidelines and were audited by the Company's independent reserve engineering firm. The 7.0 Tcfe of proved reserves at December 31, 2025 were substantially all natural gas, 41% developed and 99% operated by Comstock. The present value, using a 10% discount rate, of the future net cash flows before income taxes of the proved reserves (the "PV-10 Value"), was approximately $4.5 billion using the Company's average first of month 2025 prices of $3.07 per Mcf of natural gas and $61.98 per barrel of oil. The natural gas price used in determining the December 31, 2025 proved reserve estimates was substantially higher than the price used in 2024 of $1.84 per Mcf which allowed for the inclusion of certain proved undeveloped locations in the 2025 reserve report.
Using NYMEX future market prices as of December 31, 2025 of $3.23 per Mcf for natural gas and $56.82 per barrel of oil, as adjusted for the Company's basis differentials, proved reserves would have been 7.2 Tcfe with a PV-10 value of $5.2 billion.
The following table reflects the changes in the SEC and NYMEX proved reserve estimates since the end of 2024:

Comstock replaced 823% of its 2025 production under SEC pricing and replaced 229% of its 2025 production under NYMEX pricing.
2026 Budget
In response to improved natural gas prices, the Company currently plans to increase the number of operating drilling rigs it is running from eight to nine during 2026. Four of the rigs will be devoted to the Western Haynesville to continue to delineate the new play. As a result, Comstock plans to spend approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2026 on its development and exploration projects and $100 million to $150 million on its Western Haynesville midstream system.

Adjusted net income (loss) is presented because of its acceptance by investors and by Comstock management as an indicator of the Company's profitability excluding non-cash unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, gains and losses on sales of assets, impairment of natural gas and oil properties and other unusual items.
(2)
Adjusted net income (loss) per share is calculated to include the dilutive effects of unvested restricted stock pursuant to the two-class method and performance stock units and preferred stock pursuant to the treasury stock method.
(3)
Adjusted EBITDAX is presented in the earnings release because management believes that adjusted EBITDAX, which represents Comstock's results from operations before interest, income taxes, and certain non-cash items, including depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment of natural gas and oil properties, unrealized (gain) loss from derivative financial instruments, (gain) loss on sale of assets and exploration expense, is a common alternative measure of operating performance used by certain investors and financial analysts.
