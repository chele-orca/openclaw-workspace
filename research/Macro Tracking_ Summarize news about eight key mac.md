# Macro Tracking: Summarize news about eight key macro trackers. Highlight significant changes and prevailing trends for each.

Bond Market \& Monetary Policy:

* Term Premium
* 10-Year Real Yield (10Y Nominal Yield minus 10Y Breakeven Rate)
* Inflation Expectations (e.g., Unanchoring signs, Breakeven rates)
* 10-Year Gov’t Bond Yield vs. Nominal GDP Growth (Gap status and outlook)
Liquidity, Credit \& Economic Activity:
* Dollar Inflows/Outflows (Global Liquidity/FX Strength)
* Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) (Credit Availability)
* JOLTS Job Openings to Unemployed Ratio (Labor Market Tightness)
* Global Manufacturing PMI (Global Demand/Trade Health)

Here’s a concise read on where each of your eight trackers stands and what they’re signaling as of early February 2026.

***

## Term premium

- The 10Y term premium has moved back into clearly positive territory, with ACM‐style estimates around roughly 0.8–0.9% in early February, versus near zero/negative levels common in 2020–2021.[^1][^2]
- The key trend is a **normalized** term premium: markets are demanding more compensation for duration amid higher supply, ongoing inflation uncertainty, and questions about Fed independence later in 2026.[^3][^2]

Implication: Long rates are no longer “just policy plus expectations”; structural duration and fiscal concerns are a non‑trivial share of the 10Y yield again.

***

## 10‑year real yield

- The 10Y nominal is trading around 4.1–4.2% in mid‑February 2026.[^4][^5][^6]
- The 10Y breakeven is roughly 2.3% (Fed T10YIEM ~2.31% in January; private trackers show ~2.32% on Feb 10).[^7][^8][^9]
- That implies a 10Y **real** yield around 1.8–1.9%, elevated versus the pre‑COVID decade but off the 2023 highs.

Implication: Real financing costs are restrictive relative to the 2010s, but consistent with solid growth and no imminent recession signal.

***

## Inflation expectations

- Market 10Y breakevens are anchored near the low‑2s (about 2.3%), down from the 2022–2023 peaks but stable over recent months.[^8][^9][^7]
- Near‑term nowcasts put realized CPI around the mid‑2s YoY for February 2026, reinforcing a “2–3%” inflation regime rather than a slide back to pre‑2020 disinflation.[^10]
- No obvious unanchoring: the curve does not price a move to structurally higher inflation, but also does not believe in a rapid return to sub‑2%.

Implication: Inflation risk premia exist, but expectations remain **credibly anchored**; the hawkish tail for the Fed has moderated, yet cuts are not seen as a rush to zero.

***

## 10Y yield vs nominal GDP

- Real GDP is running hot: BEA shows annualized real growth around 4.3–4.4% in Q3 2025, the strongest since 2023.[^11][^12]
- Nominal GDP growth is in the mid‑single digits; data through mid‑2025 show nominal growth around 4.6–5% YoY, and with 4%+ real in late 2025, nominal is likely closer to 6–7% on a current‑run‑rate basis.[^13][^11]
- With the 10Y at about 4.1%, the 10Y yield still sits **below** likely nominal GDP growth, suggesting the “Buffett rule” (r < g_nom) broadly holds for the US for now.[^6][^4][^13]

Implication: From a macro lens, Treasuries don’t yet fully “compete” with nominal growth; that tends to be supportive of risk assets and consistent with debt sustainability assuming no major slowdown.

***

## Dollar inflows/outflows (global liquidity / FX)

- The DXY is in the high‑90s (around 96.9–97.1 on February 13), down about 9% over the past 12 months and roughly 2% weaker over the past month.[^14][^15][^16]
- 2025 featured a simultaneous decline in US equities and the dollar, and 2026 has opened with a further dollar slide as Fed easing, political noise, and explicit “weak dollar” rhetoric from the Trump administration undercut safe‑haven demand.[^17][^18]
- Capital flows have rotated toward Europe, Japan, and EM as carry trades reset; analysts increasingly describe this as a regime shift away from unquestioned dollar dominance rather than a cyclical blip.[^18][^19][^17]

Implication: The **trend** is toward softer USD and more two‑way volatility rather than a melt‑up; that eases global financial conditions and supports non‑US risk assets, but raises questions about longer‑term US funding.

***

## SLOOS (credit availability)

- The January 2026 SLOOS (covering Q4 2025) shows banks **tightened** standards for C\&I loans to firms of all sizes in Q4, with some easing for select sectors (notably AI‑adjacent borrowers), and largely unchanged standards for most household credit categories.[^20][^21][^22]
- Demand for business loans and CRE loans strengthened in Q4 2025, while consumer loan demand was mixed (weaker in autos and other consumer credit, roughly flat in cards).[^23][^21][^20]
- Banks expect lending standards in 2026 to remain broadly unchanged on balance, with demand gradually strengthening; large banks lean slightly toward easing, smaller banks toward further tightening.[^22][^23][^20]

Implication: Credit is still **tight versus pre‑2022**, especially for small firms, but the direction of travel is no longer aggressively tighter; we’re in a late‑cycle, selective‑lending environment rather than a full‑blown credit crunch.

***

## JOLTS job openings / unemployed ratio

- JOLTS shows job openings at about 6.54 million in December 2025, the lowest since late 2020 and down notably from mid‑2025 levels above 7.4 million.[^24][^25][^26]
- Unemployment has risen enough that unemployed workers now outnumber open jobs again; recent analysis pegs unemployment at around 7.5 million versus 6.5 million openings, putting the openings‑to‑unemployed ratio near 0.9.[^25]
- Earlier in 2025, that ratio hovered closer to 1.1, so the **trend** is from very tight to balanced/slightly slack, with quits normalized and layoff rates still relatively contained.[^27][^25]

Implication: Labor markets have cooled from “red hot” to “normal‑tight,” reducing wage‑price spiral risk while keeping enough demand to support consumption.

***

## Global manufacturing PMI

- The J.P. Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI printed 50.9 in January 2026, the sixth consecutive month above 50 and the fastest improvement in three months.[^28][^29][^30]
- New orders are rising at the strongest pace in almost a year, and employment has ticked up again, though confidence remains below long‑run averages amid geopolitical risk.[^29][^31][^19]
- Input costs and output prices have accelerated to their highest rates in nearly three years, with much of the price pressure driven by US demand.[^28][^29]

Implication: Global goods demand is **re‑accelerating** from a shallow industrial recession, with early signs of reflation in manufacturing and trade rather than renewed disinflation.

***

### Quick tactical read

- Rates: Positive term premium and 1.8–1.9% real 10Ys argue for respecting duration risk but not “bond vigilante” panic. Treasuries offer real yield, but still below nominal growth.
- Growth vs policy: Hot real growth and recovering PMIs give the Fed cover to cut slowly; inflation expectations remain anchored but not “Japanified.”
- Risk assets: Softer USD, stabilizing SLOOS, and a normalized labor market backdrop are net supportive for global risk, with the main medium‑term watchpoints being US fiscal/term premium dynamics and whether manufacturing‑driven price pressures broaden.
